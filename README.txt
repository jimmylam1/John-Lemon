Dot product:
    A dot product is used to find the angle between each Gargoyle enemy
    and the main player. Whenever the main player moves, the Gargoyles
    will rotate to directly face him. This makes the game a bit more 
    challenging as well!

Linear interpolation:
    This is used in my particle effect, which is explained more in the
    next section. Overall, the color of each particle will shoft from
    red to green depending on the distance of the main player from the 
    exit location. When the player is a distance of 7.5 units or more
    away from the exit, the color will be red. As the player approaches
    the exit, the particles will transition from red to green.

Particle effect:
    A particle effect is added to the exit point of the game. This acts
    as an indicator so the player knows where the exit point is.
